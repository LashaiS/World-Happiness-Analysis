# World Happiness Report Analysis
## Project Overview 

The project analyzes global happiness trends using data from the World Happiness Report. The goal of this analysis is to explore the key social and economic factors that contribute to happiness scores across countries and regions over time

The analysis was conducted using Python for data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis, and Tableau for data visualization and storytelling. 

## Context

The World Happiness Report is a global survey that ranks countries based on self-reported life satisfaction. Governments and researchers use this data to evaluate life and inform policy decisions. This project was completed as part of a data analytics portfolio to demonstrate my skills in data sourcing, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Research Questions 
- What factors are most strongly associated with higher happiness scores?

- How do happiness levels vary by region?

- What role do GDP, social support, and life expectancy play in overall happiness?

## Tools & Technologies 
- Python in a Jupyter Notebook was used for all analysis and visualizations
  
- pandas - main library for loading data, cleaning, merging, and exporting files

- NumPy - used for calculations and making new columns using conditions

- os - helps with file paths 

- matplotlib - for making charts and visualizations

- seaborn - for more style charts

- Tableau - to analyze and visualize data to uncover actionable insights

## Tableau Storyboard 
The final results of this analysis are presented in an interactive Tableau storyboard:
